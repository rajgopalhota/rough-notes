Answer:
I contributed to simplifying and improving our Salesforce Agent Desktop. I migrated Tableau dashboards into Salesforce, which saved Tableau licence costs and removed manual work. I designed easy-to-use, real-time dashboards for agents and managers with filters and drilldowns.
I also enabled the Rewards Hub icon for multiple card CPCs, allowing agents to access information quickly in one place. In the CPRA project, I helped move the endpoint to Salesforce UI to make the process more efficient.
I worked well with my team, communicated regularly, and delivered my tasks on time.
