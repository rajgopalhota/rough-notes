✅ Question 1: The What – Achievements in relation to objectives

Answer:
I contributed to simplifying and improving our Salesforce Agent Desktop. I migrated Tableau dashboards into Salesforce, which saved Tableau licence costs and removed manual work. I designed easy-to-use, real-time dashboards for agents and managers with filters and drilldowns.
I also enabled the Rewards Hub icon for multiple card CPCs, allowing agents to access information quickly in one place. In the CPRA project, I helped move the endpoint to Salesforce UI to make the process more efficient.
I worked well with my team, communicated regularly, and delivered my tasks on time.

Answer:
I ensured data accuracy in dashboards by applying correct logic and testing filters and date ranges. I followed best practices and review processes to avoid errors.
During the CPRA endpoint change, I validated the integration carefully to prevent system issues.
I raised risks early, followed controls, and worked with the team to deliver reliable and secure solutions.
